# Task Master
* This app has a home page, a add task page that allows you to add tasks, and a all task page to look at the tasks you have added.

## Daily Change Log:
### Lab 26 Beginning TaskMaster
    * Setup
        - To start, create a new directory and repo to hold this app. Name it taskmaster.
        - Within that directory, use Android Studio to set up a new app, as discussed in class.
        - Create a README file that includes, at minimum, a description of your app and a daily change log.
    * Feature Tasks
        - Homepage
            * The main page should be built out to match the wireframe.
            * In particular, it should have a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the “my tasks” view, and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.
        - Add a Task
            * On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body.
            * When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.
        - All Task
            * The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.
    * Documentation
        - Create a directory called screenshots in the root of your project. Take a screenshot of the homepage you’ve created.
        - Use markdown to render the screenshot in your README.
    * Testing
        - In a future lecture, we’ll talk about how to test Android UI using Espresso.
        - For now, ensure that you’re writing good unit tests for anything unit-testable in your code.
